I'm, trying to learn the basics of three.js and this is a repo where I'm trying to explore and gather a deep understanding of the basics. For this as well, I'm going to try to comment my code as much as possible to solidify the basics of the three.js library as well as show others what specific pieces of code are doing. If you're curious to see what I've build, you can visit maxsdonuts.vercel.app.
